Getting Started

The purpose of this exercise is for you to build a slideshow that displays the top N images returned from Reddit's /r/dogswithjobs subreddit! See Mockup.png for an idea of the end goal.

The goal here is not to purely demonstrate your coding ability, we're here to give you a problem that's not totally spec'd out for you, and we want to see how far you can go.

In the interest of time, we are providing the basic functionality for fetching the images from the reddit channel, check the dogapi.js file for more details.

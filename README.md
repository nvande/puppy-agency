# Puppy Employment Administration

This project provides a simple React app to enjoy a number of posts containing dog images with fun descriptions.

## Supported Features
- Use the arrows to navigate through the posts.
- Use the input at the top of the page to change the number of posts to load (1-10).
- ... that's it.

## Getting Started

First, you need to be using Node version 16 to run this app. Trying to run it with Node 17 (or later) will cause errors. You can change node versions with nvm (or whatever you prefer).

Next, before you can launch the app, you will need to install the node dependencies. To do this, run:

### `npm install`

To start the app, from the main project directory, you can run the following command:

### `npm run start`

This will run the app.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Running Automated Tests

### `npm run test`

This will run the test suite.\
Follow the instructions to specify which tests you would like to run.
